## Particle Swarm Optimization for N-Queens Problem

This Python implementation uses the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve the n-queens problem efficiently. The n-queens problem is a well-known computational challenge where the goal is to place n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other (i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).
Features:

- Fast and Efficient: Solves the n-queens problem in a few iterations with minimal computational overhead.
- PSO Algorithm: This file implements the PSO algorithm, a popular population-based optimization technique, to find valid solutions to the n-queens problem.
- Parameterizable: Easily adjustable for different values of n, allowing flexible experimentation with various board sizes.
- Python-based: Fully written in Python, offering easy integration and modifications for further optimization or experimentation.

Why PSO?

Particle Swarm Optimization is a heuristic search method inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling. It has proven effective in solving non-linear optimization problems like the n-queens challenge, and this implementation highlights its potential to solve combinatorial problems efficiently.
Usage:

1. Clone the repository or download the file.
2. Run the script in Python with your desired n value for the board size.
3. If possible, The algorithm will return a valid configuration of n queens or inform you of the failure within several iterations.

This project is intended for demonstration purposes and showcases a novel application of PSO in solving classical constraint satisfaction problems. It is ideal for those interested in optimization techniques, artificial intelligence, or algorithm design.
